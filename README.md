# salamander-reloaded

This isn't fully ready for public use,
I'm slowly moving old stuff to the new bot.

### Want to anyhow?

python3.12
requirements specified in pyproject.toml / pdm.lock

assuming you have pdm

```
pdm install
pdm run salamander --setup
pdm run salamander
```

install the requirements listed in pyproject.toml manually
entrypoint is `src/salamander/bot.py`
